### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript

### What I learned

- During this project I learned more about Regular Expressions in Javascript and it was very interesting to try different combinations to make a pattern validation for the email input field.

```javascript
const regEx = /[expression]+/g
```
- I also learned more about ways to activate some parts of CSS with Javascript, input validations and error treatment.
